# Whisper

[Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) theme based on the [Whisper](https://github.com/stsbd/whisper) theme.

Mainly customized to my own likings and applyed the [Possibilities](http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/2914885/Possibilities) color palette.

Demo can be viewed at my blog on [lightweight.no](http://lightweight.no).
